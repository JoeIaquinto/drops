# Description

Drops is a flexible event planning mobile and web app that simplifies the process to the 5 W’s: Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How? A Drop created by a user can be as detailed or open-ended as they choose by allowing guests to suggest activities, locations, and times they are available. 
Drops provides a sleeker approach to gathering your friends and taking your group chat plans to the real world because Facebook events are too inflexible and cumbersome to set up. Facebook Events Yes/ Maybe/ No does not give reliable data on when you could reschedule to allow more people to join you. Drops will utilize a built in when-is-good system to help Drop creators democratically decide when is best. Other flexible meeting and event planning solutions like [Fasterplan](http://www.fasterplan.com/) are geared towards the business world and lack integration with major social media platforms.

# Goals
----------
## Create the main Drop screen

This will be the core of the user experience in Drops. Users create, edit, and interact with a Drop. It is critical that the Drop creation process be simple and quick to complete. Hopefully Drops can save people time and energy so they can come together with their friends and turn their online plans into real life experiences.

# Team Commitments
----------

I am currently looking for more students to work on Drops with me. This would help split up the work and also get another vision for how the UX should be designed and improved. It would also be very helpful to have a teammate that is well-versed in React and mobile development.
